On the intital run, we need to add your login credential to your users ~/.netrc file, so we don't leave your username and password in the process ID, which could be seen by other users on the system (note: the initial run of this script will show up in your bash history).

`ruby fetch.rb YOUR_USERNAME YOUR_PASSWORD https://www.deviantart.com/azoexevan/gallery/`

An entry in ~/.netrc is created for you. You can then use '-n' and it will poll the netrc file for your login credentials.

`ruby fetch.rb -n https://www.deviantart.com/azoexevan/gallery/`
